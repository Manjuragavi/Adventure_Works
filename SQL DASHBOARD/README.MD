🔍 Turning Raw Data into Business Answers — SQL Project
🧩 What This Project Is About

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used as a problem-solving tool, not just a querying language.
Using a structured sales database, I explored real business questions and converted raw tables into clear, decision-ready insights.

The focus is on thinking like an analyst:
👉 What does the business want to know?
👉 How can SQL answer it efficiently?

🎯 Why I Built This Project

To strengthen hands-on SQL querying skills

To practice solving business-oriented questions

To simulate real-world data analysis tasks

To build a portfolio-ready SQL project for job applications
